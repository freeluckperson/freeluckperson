## About

I am an agricultural engineer and full-stack web developer. Although my training 📗 and work experience focus on agriculture, I have decided to explore my interest in web programming 💻. Through my ✏️ training and practice, I have acquired skills in web development both on the 🌐 front-end and back-end. I am motivated to continue learning and developing my skills in the field of web programming, and I hope to apply my knowledge to projects with attractive design and easy-to-use, intuitive navigation. 🌱📈
